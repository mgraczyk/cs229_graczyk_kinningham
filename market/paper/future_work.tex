% For future work, if you had more time, more team members, or more computational resources, what would you explore?
In this project, our training and testing used data from only a single market.
The algorithm could be made more robust by including data from more sources.
Test data drawn from a broader source would also provide a better generalization estimate.

Additionally, our algorithm could have considered features other than the product listing text when classifing products. 
For example, we could have used product price as a feature.
However, as the amount of product is not listed in a consistant format, normalizing the prices would require extracting the amount of product being sold.
