There have been several attempts to analyze anonymous marketplaces\cite{gwern-silkroad}\cite{christin-silkroad}.
In \cite{christin-silkroad}, the author crawled The Silk Road for eight months, analyzing product listings and the overall distribution of product listings.
However, they relied on vendor supplied categorizations, which do not exist for all marketplaces.
Additionally, some vendors purposely misclassify their product to appear higher in marketplace search results.
Correcting for these problems requires manual labeling of at least a large fraction of the data (as has been used in analysis on other marketplaces, such as RAMP).

Most of the machine learning techniques we used are well documented in the literature as effective building blocks for document classification systems.
We extract word features from each listing using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF),
which has proven effective in document categorization. \cite[p. 118]{manning}.
Using SVD for dimensionality reduction is a common technique for reducing the size of the feature space for document classification\cite{sun2004supervised}.

% You should find existing papers, group them into categories based on their approaches, and talk
% about them: Discuss strengths and weaknesses. In your opinion, which approaches were clever/good?
% What is the state-of-the-art? Do most people perform the task by hand? You should aim to have at
% least 5 references in the related work. Include previous attempts by others at your problem,
% previous technical methods, or previous learning algorithms. Google Scholar is very useful for this:
